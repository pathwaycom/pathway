        "As the ancient maxim says, ['errare humanum est'](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=errare_humanum_est): to err is human.\n",
        "More than two thousands years later, this lesson is still very accurate in our modern world.\n",
        "Everyone makes mistakes and writing does not escape this fate: the longer the text the more mistakes there will be.\n",
        "However, most mistakes we usually make are small and do not hinder understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, computers, just like accountants, don't like mistakes. Computers cannot cope with mistakes. No matter how small the mistake, the computer will just reject the whole answer and throw an error.\n",
        "You have written your 10-digit password but finished with a lower case 'a' instead of a capital 'A'? The passwords obviously do not match, and you shall enter your password again!\n",
        "\n",
        "While this zero tolerance policy may make sense for security processes, it can be terrible when users have to enter long texts.\n",
        "For example, accountants may have to enter long logs of transactions by hand, creating many opportunities for mistakes.\n",
        "If those logs have to be compared to other logs (e.g. a log automatically generated by a pay station) then mismatches would appear: 'mr' instead of 'Mr'.\n",
        "Mistakes can also come from the way the data has been collected: using nicknames instead of full names, different email addresses etc.\n",
        "While humans could be able to match those logs despite the mistakes, computers cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "Does it mean the computer is helpless in those cases, shifting all the tedious work of matching similar but different entries to human?\n",
        "Fortunately not, several mechanisms exist to assist or even perform the matching, and **fuzzy join** is one of them: a fuzzy join is process which automatically matches entries from different logs despite not having a perfect matching between their keys."
