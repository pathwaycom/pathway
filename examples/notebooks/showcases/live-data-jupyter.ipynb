        "Jupyter notebooks are a great tool for working with data. They give you a friendly interactive interface in which you can process data comfortably and visualise it in intuitive, human-readable ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most data analysts use Jupyter notebooks with static (or \"batch\") workflows. Using Jupyter with streaming workflows can feel intimidating or have mixed results due to inadequate tooling.\n",

        "In this notebook you will learn how to visualise a live data stream in real-time from the familiar context of a Jupyter Notebook. You will use Pathway, [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) and [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) to build a real-time data visualisation that will alert you when the data hits a critical threshold. You can follow along on this page or run the code for yourself [in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/examples/notebooks/showcases/live-data-jupyter.ipynb) or [from Github](https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/examples/notebooks/showcases/live-data-jupyter.ipynb).\n",
        "\n",
        "Because Pathway [unites static and stream processing](/developers/user-guide/connect/switch-from-batch-to-streaming#switching-from-batch-to-streaming) in a single syntax, you can use the exact same code for both batch and streaming. This way you can test your workflow with a static snapshot and then simply switch out the data source for a live stream when you want to visualise the full data flow in real-time.\n",

This will be a helpful example of visualizing streaming data and will also show the usefulness of getting critical alerts in real-time.\n",
        "\n",
        "You don't need to fully understand the algorithm or the financial terminology. Focus on the steps you will to take a live data stream, perform some computation on it in real-time, and output a data visualisation in your Jupyter Notebook that updates on-the-fly. These steps are generalizable to any data streaming use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "Concretely, we will compute the 1-minute running mean of Volume Weighted Average Price (`vwap`) and the 20-minute volatility, the Volume Weighted Standard Deviation (`wvstd`) on the price time series. This creates two bands around the mean price, with most price movements happening between the bands. Intuitively, when a price approaches the upper band, it is abnormally high and may likely drop - it is a good moment to _SELL_ and we'll raise an alert. Likewise, when the price approaches the lower band, it indicates it is low and may grow to revert to the mean - we'll raise an alert that it's a good moment to _BUY_. For further reliability, the BUY/SELL actions are performed only when there is a significant volume of trades, indicating that the outlying price is not a one-off event."
