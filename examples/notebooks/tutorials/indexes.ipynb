Thanks to that, new records arriving in any of the two streams can be joined quickly - it is enough to look them up in the index of the other table and no costly scans are needed.\n",

It'll return the closest points once and will forget the query. However, it'll monitor the stream containing index data and update the index if new data arrives (but won't update old queries). As a result, if you ask the same query again and the index has changed in the meantime, you can get a different answer.
