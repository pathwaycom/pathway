        "One way of transforming data in Pathway, when simple transformations are not enough, is using [UDFs](/developers/user-guide/data-transformation/user-defined-functions).\n",

        "It acts on the whole Pathway Table and returns a new Table.\n",

        "without waiting for the previous batches to finish.\n",
        "When the call is finished, its result is returned to the engine with a new processing time.\n",
        "\n",
        "To write an `AsyncTransformer` you need to inherit from [`pw.AsyncTransformer`](/developers/api-docs/pathway#pathway.AsyncTransformer) and implement the [`invoke` method](/developers/api-docs/pathway#pathway.AsyncTransformer.invoke) (it is a coroutine). The names of the arguments of the method have to be the same as the columns in the input table. You can use additional arguments but then you have to specify their default value (it might be useful if you want to use the same `AsyncTransformer` on multiple Pathway tables with different sets of columns). You have to use all columns from the input table. The order of columns/arguments doesn't matter as they are passed to the method as keyword arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "You also need to define the schema of a table that is produced. The `invoke` method has to return a dictionary containing values to put in all columns of the output table. The keys in the dictionary has to match fields from the output schema.\n",
