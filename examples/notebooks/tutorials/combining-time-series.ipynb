For example, we can use time series data to forecast future values, identify anomalies, or monitor changes in a system.\n",

        " - Environmental monitoring \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f: Combining time series data from air quality sensors, weather stations, and pollutant levels can provide a comprehensive understanding of the environment's condition, aid in pollution control efforts, and support urban planning initiatives.\n",
        " - Supply chain management \ud83d\udce6: Combining time series data on inventory levels, production rates, transportation delays, and customer demand can optimize inventory management, improve delivery schedules, and enhance overall supply chain efficiency.\n",
        " - Analyzing stock market data \ud83d\udcc8: Combining time series of stock prices, trading volumes, and financial indicators can provide a comprehensive view of the market's behavior and aid in identifying trends, correlations, and investment opportunities.\n",
        " - Technical analysis and development \ud83c\udfce\ufe0f: Combining time series data on car sensors readings, engine performance, aerodynamic data, and telemetry can aid in the technical analysis and development of Formula 1 cars, leading to improvements in speed, reliability, and overall performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Combining time series is an essential operation in time series analysis, but it can be challenging due to the need for matching timestamps between different datasets.
