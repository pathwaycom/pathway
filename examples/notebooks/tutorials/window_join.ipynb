Joining clickstream data with purchase data can be particularly useful for businesses in analyzing the success of product page visits converting into purchases, improving their marketing strategies and product offerings.\n",

        "The `window_join` function from Pathway associates records from two different tables that occur within the same time frame, specified by a window of time, creating sets of temporally correlated records.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a `window_join`, all pairs of records that fall within the same window and satisfy the specified conditions are joined together. This operation is performed for each window whether it is a sliding window, a session window or a tumbling window. In the case of a sliding window, this means the window slides across the time axis, capturing different subsets of records at each step.\n",

The time window and conditions could be adjusted to cater to different business questions and analysis requirements. This makes the window join an incredibly powerful tool for temporal data analysis, allowing us to track and analyze patterns over time and within specific timeframes.\n",
