        "Welcome to this detailed tutorial on how to analyze user behavior by correlating clickstream data with purchase data using Pathway's window join functionality. Joining clickstream data with purchase data can be particularly useful for businesses in analyzing the success of product page visits converting into purchases, improving their marketing strategies and product offerings.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `window_join` function from Pathway associates records from two different tables that occur within the same time frame, specified by a window of time, creating sets of temporally correlated records.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a `window_join`, all pairs of records that fall within the same window and satisfy the specified conditions are joined together. This operation is performed for each window whether it is a sliding window, a session window or a tumbling window. In the case of a sliding window, this means the window slides across the time axis, capturing different subsets of records at each step.\n",

        "Consider an e-commerce example: the window join can be used to identify instances where product page visits and purchases occurred within the same hour. The time window and conditions could be adjusted to cater to different business questions and analysis requirements. This makes the window join an incredibly powerful tool for temporal data analysis, allowing us to track and analyze patterns over time and within specific timeframes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our hypothetical e-commerce example, there are two datasets:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The goal here is to monitor the evolution of conversion rates for each product page. In this context, a conversion refers to a scenario where a page visit and a purchase occur within a defined time window.
