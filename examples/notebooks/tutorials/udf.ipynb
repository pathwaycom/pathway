        "If you're sure that your function is deterministic, you can set `deterministic=True` as it usually improves the speed and memory requirements of the computation.\n",
        "However sometimes the function may be nondeterministic in a non-obvious way. For example, some linear algebra operations on floating point numbers that use multithreading under the hood can return slightly different results across runs. Such functions are not deterministic.\n",
        "If this explanation is enough for you, feel free to skip to the next section.\n",
        "If you want to learn more about how Pathway handles non-deterministic functions, dive in.\n",

        "To maintain consistency, it'll memoize the result of a UDF call until the corresponding input row is deleted.\n",
        "Being able to produce deleting rows is the reason why Pathway has to store the results of UDFs.\n",
        "The values in the inserted and deleted entries have to be the same so that they can cancel out.\n",
        "If a UDF is non-deterministic, it can produce a different value and the entries can't cancel out as they are not equal.\n",
        "To get the same values at row deletion as at insertion, the results have to be remembered.\n",
        "When the row is deleted, there is no more need to remember the result of the call and it can be discarded.\n",

        "When you're sure that the function is deterministic, you can avoid storing the results by setting `deterministic=True` in the `pw.udf` decorator.\n",
