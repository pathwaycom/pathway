        "# Performing Interval Joins in Pathway\n",
        "This article offers a comprehensive tutorial on how to use the interval join function in Pathway to accurately compute the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for vehicles.\n",
        "\n",
        "The practice of temporal data analysis often invokes the use of interval joins, which diverge from the conventional join operation by virtue of a more adaptable matching strategy. Rather than linking records from two tables based purely on a precise key match, interval joins offer a compound inequality based linkage.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, the interval join merges records by comparing the timestamp from each record of two tables and evaluates whether the difference falls within a specified time window or `interval`.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Illustration of interval join](https://pathway.com/assets/content/tutorials/fleet_eta_interval_join/illustrative_interval_join.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "This operation is especially useful in time-series data processing scenarios. For instance, when processing streaming data, data points may not arrive at the system simultaneously due to differences in data production speed, network latency, or other factors. Interval join comes to the rescue by enabling the system to align data points that are closest in time, thus facilitating real-time data analysis and decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, you will calculate the estimated time of arrival (ETA) for each vehicle in a fleet given its current location, destination, the route it's taking, and any potential route maintenance delays.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Setting Up the Tables\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's start by defining the tables: vehicle locations, routes, and maintenance schedules. For the sake of this tutorial, you could use `pw.debug.table_from_markdown` function to create tables from markdown formatted string. Please refer to our article about [connectors in Pathway](/developers/user-guide/connect/pathway-connectors/) to find out more about data connectors. Be assured that this code is compatible with the streaming mode."

This kind of processing is common in transportation and logistics, and Pathway makes it easy to handle in real time."
