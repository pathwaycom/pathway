        "\n",
        "> In streaming workflows, this is very different. Data is not static but dynamic. You don't know the size or content of your dataset before you start processing: the processing happens *as* the data is being generated.\n",
        "\n",
        "> This means that we can't structure our processing around 'batches' of data the way we did in `pandas`: the whole point of data streaming is to process data in real-time, not sit around waiting until all of the data has been collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "> So instead, data streaming pipelines are built around 'events': specific moments when something happens to our data. Common events are data being created, removed, or updated. Whenever an event happens, the data streaming pipeline is triggered and data processing starts.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our case, we will create a Pathway table by listening to a directory for new events (in this case `./sum_input_data/`) and defining the schema of the table which maps the columns to their data types. Be sure to toggle streaming mode on by setting `mode` to `streaming`."

They only want to give them money that's actually in their account, and then adjust the account balance to reflect the change. This means the ATM withdrawal needs to be syncronised exactly with the adjustment in the customer's account balance. In order to do this we need to know the `time` at which the event happened and the amount that was changed (or the `diff`).\n",
