# Motivation

Differential dataflow programs are structured as two easy steps:

        1. Write a program.
        2. Change its input.

We will work through an example program, and then interact with it by changing its inputs. Our goal is foremost to show you what a program looks like, and to give you a sense for what interactions look like.

Once we've done this, in the next chapter we will jazz things up a bit with an increased scale of data, computation, and interaction!
