# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New external integration with [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/).
- `pw.io.mysql.write` method for writing to MySQL. It supports two output table types: stream of changes and a realtime-updated data snapshot.

### Changed
- `pw.io.deltalake.read` now accepts the `start_from_timestamp_ms` parameter for non-append-only tables. In this case, the connector will replay the history of changes in the table version by version starting from the state of the table at the given timestamp. The differences between versions will be applied atomically.
- Asynchronous UDFs for connecting to API based llm and embedding models now have by default retry strategy set to `pw.udfs.ExponentialRetryStrategy()`
- `pw.io.postgres.write` method now supports two output table types: stream of changes and realtime-updated data snapshot. The output table type can be chosen with the `output_table_type` parameter.
- `pw.io.postgres.write_snapshot` method has been deprecated.

## [0.26.3] - 2025-10-03

### Added
- New parser `pathway.xpacks.llm.parsers.PaddleOCRParser` supporting parsing of PDF, PPTX and images.

## [0.26.2] - 2025-10-01

### Added
- `pw.io.gdrive.read` now supports the `"only_metadata"` format. When this format is used, the table will contain only metadata updates for the tracked directory, without reading object contents.
- Detailed metrics can now be exported to SQLite. Enable this feature using the environment variable `PATHWAY_DETAILED_METRICS_DIR` or via `pw.set_monitoring_config()`.
- `pw.io.kinesis.read` and `pw.io.kinesis.write` methods for reading from and writing to AWS Kinesis.

### Fixed
- A bug leading to potentially unbounded memory consumption that could occur in `Table.forget` and `Table.sort` operators during multi-worker runs has been fixed.
- Improved memory efficiency during cold starts by compacting intermediary structures and reducing retained memory after backfilling.

### Changed
- The frequency of background operator snapshot compression in data persistence is limited to the greater of the user-defined `snapshot_interval` or 30 minutes when S3 or Azure is used as the backend, in order to avoid frequent calls to potentially expensive operations.
- The Google Drive input connector performance has been improved, especially when handling directories with many nested subdirectories.
- The MCP server `tool` method now allows to pass the optional data `title`, `output_schema`, `annotations` and `meta` to inform the LLM client.
- Relaxed boto3 dependency to <2.0.0.

## [0.26.1] - 2025-08-28

### Added
- `pw.Table.forget` to remove old (in terms of event time) entries from the pipeline.
- `pw.Table.buffer`, a stateful buffering operator that delays entries until `time_column <= max(time_column) - threshold` condition is met.
- `pw.Table.ignore_late` to filter out old (in terms of event time) entries.
- Rows batching for async UDFs. It can be enabled with `max_batch_size` parameter.

### Changed
- `pw.io.subscribe` and `pw.io.python.write` now work with async callbacks.
- The `diff` column in tables automatically created by `pw.io.postgres.write` and `pw.io.postgres.write_snapshot` in `replace` and `create_if_not_exists` initialization modes now uses the `smallint` type.
- `optimize_transaction_log` option has been removed from `pw.io.deltalake.TableOptimizer`.

### Fixed
- `pw.io.postgres.write` and `pw.io.postgres.write_snapshot` now respect the type optionality defined in the Pathway table schema when creating a new PostgreSQL table. This applies to the `replace` and `create_if_not_exists` initialization modes.

## [0.26.0] - 2025-08-14

### Added
- `path_filter` parameter in `pw.io.s3.read` and `pw.io.minio.read` functions. It enables post-filtering of object paths using a wildcard pattern (`*`, `?`), allowing exclusion of paths that pass the main `path` filter but do not match `path_filter`.
- Input connectors now support backpressure control via `max_backlog_size`, allowing to limit the number of read events in processing per connector. This is useful when the data source emits a large initial burst followed by smaller, incremental updates.
- `pw.reducers.count_distinct` and `pw.reducers.count_distinct_approximate` to count the number of distinct elements in a table. The `pw.reducers.count_distinct_approximate` allows you to save memory by decreasing the accuracy. It is possible to control this tradeoff by using the `precision` parameter.
- `pw.Table.join` (and its variants) now has two additional parameters - `left_exactly_once` and `right_exactly_once`. If the elements from a side of a join should be joined exactly once, `*_exactly_once` parameter of the side can be set to `True`. Then after getting a match an entry will be removed from the join state and the memory consumption will be reduced.

### Changed
- Delta table compression logging has been improved: logs now include table names, and verbose messages have been streamlined while preserving details of important processing steps.
- Improved initialization speed of `pw.io.s3.read` and `pw.io.minio.read`.
- `pw.io.s3.read` and `pw.io.minio.read` now limit the number and the total size of objects to be predownloaded.
- **BREAKING** optimized the implementation of `pw.reducers.min`, `pw.reducers.max`, `pw.reducers.argmin`, `pw.reducers.argmax`, `pw.reducers.any` reducers for append-only tables. It is a breaking change for programs using operator persistence. The persisted state will have to be recomputed.
- **BREAKING** optimized the implementation of `pw.reducers.sum` reducer on `float` and `np.ndarray` columns. It is a breaking change for programs using operator persistence. The persisted state will have to be recomputed.
- **BREAKING** the implementation of data persistence has been optimized for the case of many small objects in filesystem and S3 connectors. It is a breaking change for programs using data persistence. The persisted state will have to be recomputed.
- **BREAKING** the data snapshot logic in persistence has been optimized for the case of big input snapshots. It is a breaking change for programs using data persistence. The persisted state will have to be recomputed.
- Improved precision of `pw.reducers.sum` on `float` columns by introducing Neumeier summation.

## [0.25.1] - 2025-07-24

### Added
- `pw.xpacks.llm.mcp_server.PathwayMcp` that allows serving `pw.xpacks.llm.document_store.DocumentStore` and `pw.xpacks.llm.question_answering` endpoints as MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools.
- `pw.io.dynamodb.write` method for writing to Dynamo DB.

## [0.25.0] - 2025-07-10

### Added
- `pw.io.questdb.write` method for writing to Quest DB.
- `pw.io.fs.read` now supports the `"only_metadata"` format. When this format is used, the table will contain only metadata updates for the tracked directory, without reading file contents.
- `pw.Table.to_stream` that transforms a table to a stream of changes from this table.
- `pw.Table.stream_to_table`, `pw.Table.from_streams` that transform a streams of changes to tables.
- `pw.Table.assert_append_only` that sets append_only property of a table and verifies at runtime if the condition is met.

### Changed
- **BREAKING** The Elasticsearch and BigQuery connectors have been moved to the Scale license tier. You can obtain the Scale tier license for free at https://pathway.com/get-license.
- **BREAKING** `pw.io.fs.read` no longer accepts `format="raw"`. Use `format="binary"` to read binary objects, `format="plaintext_by_file"` to read plaintext objects per file, or `format="plaintext"` to read plaintext objects split into lines.
- **BREAKING** The `pw.io.s3_csv.read` connector has been removed. Please use `pw.io.s3.read` with `format="csv"` instead.

### Fixed
- `pw.io.s3.read` and `pw.io.s3.write` now also check the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable for AWS credentials if none are explicitly provided.

## [0.24.1] - 2025-07-03

### Added
- Confluent Schema Registry support in Kafka and Redpanda input and output connectors.

### Changed
- `pw.io.airbyte.read` will now retry the pip install command if it fails during the installation of a connector. It only applies when using the PyPI version of the connector, not the Docker one.
- Environment variables used in YAML configuration files are no longer being parsed as if they were YAML files by the `pw.load_yaml`. Now, the value of the environment variable is only parsed if it's an integer, a float or a boolean.

## [0.24.0] - 2025-06-26

### Added
- `pw.io.mqtt.read` and `pw.io.mqtt.write` methods for reading from and writing to MQTT.

### Changed
- `pw.xpacks.llm.embedders.SentenceTransformerEmbedder` and `pw.xpacks.llm.llms.HFPipelineChat` are now computed in batches. The maximum size of a single batch can be set in the constructor with the argument `max_batch_size`.
- **BREAKING** Arguments `api_key` and `base_url` for `pw.xpacks.llm.llms.OpenAIChat` can no longer be set in the `__call__` method, and instead, if needed, should be set in the constructor.
- **BREAKING** Argument `api_key` for `pw.xpacks.llm.llms.OpenAIEmbedder` can no longer be set in the `__call__` method, and instead, if needed, should be set in the constructor.
- `pw.io.postgres.write` now accepts arbitrary types for the values of the `postgres_settings` dict. If a value is not a string, Python's `str()` method will be used.

### Removed
- `pw.io.kafka.read_from_upstash` has been removed, as the managed Kafka service in Upstash has been deprecated.

## [0.23.0] - 2025-06-12

### Added
- `pw.io.deltalake.write` now accepts an optional `pw.io.deltalake.TableOptimizer` object that defines the settings for the runtime output table optimization.

### Fixed
- `pw.io.deltalake.read` now correctly reads data from partitioned tables in all cases.
- Added retries for all cloud-based persistence backend operations to improve reliability.

## [0.22.0] - 2025-06-05

### Added
- Data persistence can now be configured to use Azure Blob Storage as a backend. An Azure backend instance can be created using `pw.persistence.Backend.azure` and included in the persistence config.
- Added batching to UDFs. It is now possible to make UDFs operate on batches of data instead of single rows. To do so `max_batch_size` argument has to be set.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: when creating `pw.DateTimeUtc` it is now obligatory to pass the time zone information.
- **BREAKING**: when creating `pw.DateTimeNaive` passing time zone information is not allowed.
- **BREAKING**: expressions are now evaluated in batches. Generally, it speeds up the computations but might increase the memory usage if the intermediate state in the expressions is large.

### Fixed
- Synchronization groups now correctly handle cases where the source file-like object is updated during the reading process.

## [0.21.6] - 2025-05-29

### Added
- `sort_by` method to `pw.BaseCustomAccumulator` that allows to sort rows within a single batch. When `sort_by` is defined the rows are reduced in the order specified by the `sort_by` method. It can for example be used to process entries in the order of event time.

### Changed
- `pw.Table.debug` now prints a whole row in a single line instead of printing each cell separately.
- Calling functions without arguments in YAML configurations files is now deprecated in `pw.load_yaml`. To call the function a mapping should be passed, e.g. empty mapping as `{}`. In the future `!` syntax without any mapping will be used to pass function objects without calling them.
- The license check error message now provides a more detailed explanation of the failure.
- When code is run using `pathway spawn` with multiple processes, if one process terminates with an error, all other processes will also be terminated.
- `pw.xpacks.llm.vector_store.VectorStoreServer` is being deprecated, and it is now subclass of `pw.xpacks.llm.document_store.DocumentStore`. Public API is being kept the same, however users are encouraged to switch to using `DocumentStore` from now on. 
- `pw.xpacks.llm.vector_store.VectorStoreClient` is being deprecated in favor of `pw.xpacks.llm.document_store.DocumentStoreClient`.
- `pw.io.deltalake.write` can now maintain the target table's snapshot on the output.

## [0.21.5] - 2025-05-09

### Changed
- `pw.io.deltalake.read` now processes Delta table version updates atomically, applying all changes together in a single minibatch.
- The panel widget for table visualization now has a horizontal scroll bar for large tables.
- Added the possibility to return value from any column from `pw.reducers.argmax` and `pw.reducers.argmin`, not only `id`.

### Fixed
- `pw.reducers.argmax` and `pw.reducers.argmin` work correctly with the result of `pw.Table.windowby`.

## [0.21.4] - 2025-04-24

### Added
- `pw.io.kafka.read` and `pw.io.redpanda.read` now support static mode.

### Changed
- The `inactivity_detection` function is now a method for append only tables. It no longer relies on an event timestamp column but now uses table processing times to detect inactivity periods.

## [0.21.3] - 2025-04-16

### Fixed
- The performance of input connectors is optimized in certain cases.
- The panel widget for table visualization does now a better formatting for timestamps and missing values. The pagination was also updated to better fit the widget and the default sorters in snapshot mode have been fixed.

## [0.21.2] - 2025-04-10

### Added
- Added synchronization group mechanism to align multiple data sources based on selected columns. It can be accessed with `pw.io.register_input_synchronization_group`.
- `pw.io.register_input_synchronization_group` now supports the following types of columns: `pw.DateTimeUtc`, `pw.DateTimeNaive`, `pw.DateTimeDuration`, and `int`.

### Changed
- Enhanced error reporting for runtime errors across most operators, providing a trace that simplifies identifying the root cause.

### Fixed
- Bugfix for problem with list_documents() when no documents present in store.
- The append-only property of tables created by `pw.io.kafka.read` is now set correctly.

## [0.21.1] - 2025-03-28

### Changed
- Input connectors now throttle parsing error messages if their share is more than 10% of the parsing attempts.
- New flag `return_status` for `inputs_query` method in `pw.xpacks.llm.DocumentStore`. If set to True, DocumentStore returns the status of indexing for each file.

## [0.21.0] - 2025-03-19

### Added
- All Pathway types can now be serialized to CSV using `pw.io.csv.write` and deserialized back using `pw.io.csv.read`.
- `pw.io.csv.read` now parses null-values in data when it can be done unambiguously.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Updated endpoints in `pw.xpacks.llm.question_answering.BaseRAGQuestionAnswerer`:
  - Deprecated: `/v1/pw_list_documents`, `/v1/pw_ai_answer`
  - New: `/v2/list_documents`, `/v2/answer`
- RAG methods under the `pw.xpacks.llm.question_answering.RAGClient` are re-named, and they now use the new endpoints. Old methods are deprecated and will be removed in the future.
  - `pw_ai_summary` -> `summarize`
  - `pw_ai_answer` -> `answer`
  - `pw_list_documents` -> `list_documents`
- When `pw.io.deltalake.write` creates a table, it also stores its metadata in the columns of the created Delta table. This metadata can be used by Pathway when reading the table with `pw.io.deltalake.read` if no `schema` is specified.
- The `schema` parameter is now optional for `pw.io.deltalake.read`. If the table was created by Pathway and the `schema` was not specified by user, it is read from the table metadata.
- `pw.io.deltalake.write` now aligns the output metadata with the existing table's metadata, preserving any custom metadata in the sink.
- **BREAKING**: The `Bytes` type is now serialized and deserialized with base64 encoding and decoding when the CSV format is used.

- Better error messages when using `pathway spawn` with multiple workers. Now error messages are printed only from the worker experiencing the error directly.

### Fixed
- `doc_post_processors` argument in the `pw.xpacks.llm.document_store.DocumentStore` had no effect. This is now fixed.

## [0.19.0] - 2025-02-20

- **BREAKING**: Marked package as **py.typed** to indicate support for type hints.

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Removed undocumented `license_key` argument from `pw.run` and `pw.run_all` methods. Instead, `pw.set_license_key` should be used.

- `pw.io.deltalake.read` can now stream the tables with deletions, if no deletion vectors were used.

### Changed
- `pw.io.sharepoint.read` now explicitly terminates with an error if it fails to read the data the specified number of times per row (the default is `8`).
- `pw.xpacks.llm.prompts.prompt_qa`, and other prompts expect 'context' and 'query' fields instead of 'docs'. 
- Removed support for `short_prompt_template` and `long_prompt_template` in `pw.xpacks.llm.question_answering.BaseRAGQuestionAnswerer`. These prompt variants are no longer accepted during construction or in requests.
- `pw.xpacks.llm.question_answering.BaseRAGQuestionAnswerer` allows setting user created prompts. Templates are verified to include 'context' and 'query' placeholders.
- `pw.xpacks.llm.question_answering.BaseRAGQuestionAnswerer` can take a `BaseContextProcessor` that represents context documents to the LLM. Defaults to `pw.xpacks.llm.question_answering.SimpleContextProcessor` which filters metadata fields and joins the documents with new lines.

### Fixed
- The input of `pw.io.fs.read` and `pw.io.s3.read` is now correctly persisted in case deletions or modifications of already processed objects take place.

## [0.16.1] - 2024-12-12

### Changed
- `pw.io.s3.read` now monitors object deletions and modifications in the S3 source, when ran in streaming mode. When an object is deleted in S3, it is also removed from the engine. Similarly, if an object is modified in S3, the engine updates its state to reflect those changes.
- `pw.io.s3.read` now supports `with_metadata` flag, which makes it possible to attach the metadata of the source object to the table entries.

### Fixed
- `pw.xpacks.llm.document_store.DocumentStore` no longer requires `_metadata` column in the input table.

## [0.16.0] - 2024-11-29

### Added
- `pw.xpacks.llm.document_store.SlidesDocumentStore`, which is a subclass of `pw.xpacks.llm.document_store.DocumentStore` customized for retrieving slides from presentations.
- `pw.temporal.inactivity_detection` and `pw.temporal.utc_now` functions allowing for alerting and other time dependent usecases

### Changed
- `pw.Table.concat`, `pw.Table.with_id`, `pw.Table.with_id_from` no longer perform checks if ids are unique. It improves memory usage.
- table operations that store values (like `pw.Table.join`, `pw.Table.update_cells`) no longer store columns that are not used downstream.
- `append_only` column property is now propagated better (there are more places where we can infer it).
- **BREAKING**: Parsers and parser utilities including `OpenParse`, `ParseUnstructured`, `ParseUtf8`, `parse_images` are now async. Parser interface in the `VectorStore` and `DocumentStore` remains unchanged.
- **BREAKING**: Unused arguments from the constructor `pw.xpacks.llm.question_answering.DeckRetriever` are no longer accepted. 

### Fixed
- `query_as_of_now` of `pw.stdlib.indexing.DataIndex` and `pw.stdlib.indexing.HybridIndex` now work in constant memory for infinite query stream (no query-related data is kept after query is answered).

### Added
- `pw.io.kafka.read` now supports reading entries starting from a specified timestamp.
- `pw.io.nats.read` and `pw.io.nats.write` methods for reading from and writing Pathway tables to NATS.

### Changed
- `pw.Table.diff` now supports setting `instance` parameter that allows computing differences for multiple groups.
- `pw.io.postgres.write_snapshot` now keeps the Postgres table fully in sync with the current state of the table in Pathway. This means that if an entry is deleted in Pathway, the same entry will also be deleted from the Postgres table managed by the output connector.

### Fixed
- `pw.PyObjectWrapper` is now picklable.
- `query_as_of_now` of `pw.stdlib.indexing.DataIndex` and `pw.stdlib.indexing.HybridIndex` now work in constant memory for infinite query stream (no query-related data is kept after query is answered).

- `pw.io.deltalake.read` now supports specifying both a custom endpoint and a custom region for Delta Lakes via `pw.io.s3.AwsS3Settings`.

### Changed
- Indices in `pathway.stdlib.indexing.nearest_neighbors` can now work also on numpy arrays. Previously they only accepted `list[float]`. Working with numpy arrays improves memory efficiency.
- `pw.io.s3.read` has been optimized to minimize new object requests whenever possible.
- It is now possible to set the size limit of cache in `pw.udfs.DiskCache`.
- State persistence now uses a single backend for both metadata and stream storage. The `pw.persistence.Config.simple_config` method is therefore deprecated. Now you can use the `pw.persistence.Config` constructor with the same parameters that were previously used in `simple_config`.

### Fixed
- `pw.io.bigquery.write` connector now correctly handles `pw.Json` columns.

- `next` method to `pw.io.python.ConnectorSubject` (python connector) that enables passing values of any type to the engine, not only values that are json-serializable. The `next` method should be the preferred way of passing values from the python connector.

### Changed
- The `format` argument of `pw.io.python.read` is deprecated. A data format is inferred from the method used (`next_json`, `next_str`, `next_bytes`) and the provided schema.

- Introduced the `reranker` module under `llm.xpacks`. Includes few re-ranking strategies and utility functions for RAG applications.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `windowby` generates IDs of produced rows differently than in the previous version.
- **BREAKING**: `pw.io.csv.write` prints printable non-ascii characters as regular text, not `\u{xxxx}`.
- **BREAKING**: Connector methods `pw.io.elasticsearch.read`, `pw.io.debezium.read`, `pw.io.fs.read`, `pw.io.jsonlines.read`, `pw.io.kafka.read`, `pw.io.python.read`, `pw.io.redpanda.read`, `pw.io.s3.read` now check the type of the input data. Previously it was not checked if the provided format was `"json"`/`"jsonlines"`. If the data is inconsistent with the provided schema, the row is skipped and the error message is emitted.
- **BREAKING**: `query` and `query_as_of_now` methods of `pathway.stdlib.indexing.data_index.DataIndex` now return `pathway.JoinResult`, to allow resolving column name conflicts (between columns in the table with queries and table with index data).
- **BREAKING**: DataIndex methods `query` and `query_as_of_now` now return score in a column named `_pw_index_reply_score` (defined as `_SCORE` variable in `pathway.stdlib.indexing.colnames.py`).

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: `pathway.stdlib.indexing.data_index.VectorDocumentIndex` class, some predefined instances are now meant to be obtained via methods provided in `pathway.stdlib.indexing.vector_document_index`.
- **BREAKING**: `with_distances` parameter of `query` and `query_as_of_now` methods in `pathway.stdlib.indexing.data_index.DataIndex`. Instead of 'distance', we now operate with a more general term 'score' (higher = better). For distance based indices score is usually defined as negative distance. Score is now always included in the answer, as long as underlying index returns something that indicates quality of a match.

## [0.10.1] - 2024-04-30

### Added
- `query` method to VectorStoreServer to enable compatible API with `DataIndex`.

### Added
- Pathway now warns when unintentionally creating Table with empty universe.
- `pw.io.kafka.write` in `raw` and `plaintext` formats now supports output for tables with multiple columns. For such tables, it requires the specification of the column that must be used as a value of the produced Kafka messages and gives a possibility to provide column which must be used as a key.
- `pw.io.kafka.write` can now output values from the table using Kafka message headers in 'raw' and 'plaintext' output format.

### Changed
- `instance` arguments to `groupby`, `join`, `with_id_from` now determine how entries are distributed between machines.
- `flatten` results remain on the same machine as their source entries.
- `join` sends each record between machines at most once.
- **BREAKING**: `flatten`, `join`, `groupby` (if used with `instance`), `with_id_from` (if used with `instance`) generate IDs of the produced rows differently than in the previous versions.
- `pathway spawn` with multiple workers prints only output from the first worker.

## [0.9.0] - 2024-04-18

### Added
- `pw.reducers.latest` and `pw.reducers.earliest` that return the value with respectively maximal and minimal processing time assigned.

- `pw.io.pubsub.write` connector for publishing Pathway tables into Google PubSub.
- Argument `strict_prompt` to `answer_with_geometric_rag_strategy` and `answer_with_geometric_rag_strategy_from_index` that allows optimizing prompts for smaller open-source LLM models.
- Temporarily switch LiteLLMChat's generation method to sync version due to a bug while using `json` mode with Ollama.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `pw.io.kafka.read` will not parse the messages from UTF-8 in case `raw` mode was specified. To preserve this behavior you can use the `plaintext` mode.
- **BREAKING**: `Table.flatten` now flattens one column and spreads every other column of the table, instead of taking other columns from the argument list.

## [0.8.6] - 2024-04-10

- Enhanced the `table.col.dt.timestamp` method with a new `unit` argument to specify the unit of the returned timestamp.

### Experimental Features
- Introduced an experimental xpack with a Microsoft SharePoint input connector.

## Enhancements

### Improved JSON Handling
- Index operator (`[]`) can now be directly applied to `pw.Json` within UDFs to access elements of JSON objects, arrays, and strings.

### Expanded Timestamp Functionality
- Enhanced the `table.col.dt.from_timestamp` method to create `DateTimeNaive` from timestamps represented as `int`s or `float`s.
- Deprecated not specifying the `unit` argument of the `table.col.dt.timestamp` method.

- `KNNIndex` now supports returning computed distances.
- Added support for cosine similarity in `KNNIndex`.

### Deprecated Features
- The `offset` argument of `pw.stdlib.temporal.sliding` and `pw.stdlib.temporal.tumbling` is deprecated. Use `origin` instead, as it represents a point in time, not a duration.

## Bug Fixes

### DateTime Fixes
- Sliding window now works correctly with UTC Datetimes.

### `asof_join` Improvements
- Temporal column in `asof_join` no longer has to be named `t`.
- `asof_join` includes rows with equal times for all values of the `direction` parameter.

- `pw.io.subscribe()` takes additional argument `on_time_end` - the callback function to be called on each closed time of computation.
- `pw.io.subscribe()` is now a single-worker operator, guaranteeing that `on_end` is triggered at most once.
- `KNNIndex` supports now metadata filtering. Each query can specify it's own filter in the JMESPath format.

### Fixed
- Resolved an optimization bug causing `pw.iterate` to malfunction when handling columns effectively pointing to the same data.

## [0.7.4] - 2023-12-05

### Changed
- Pathway now keeps track of `array` columntype better - it is able to keep track of Array dtype and number of dimensions, wherever applicable.

### Fixed
- Fixed issues with standalone panel+Bokeh dashboards to ensure optimal functionality and performance.

## [0.7.3] - 2023-11-30

### Added
- A method `weekday` has been added to the `dt` namespace, that can be called on column expressions containing datetime data. This method returns an integer that represents the day of the week.

- **EXPERIMENTAL**: `pw.io.gdrive.read` has a new argument `with_metadata` (by default `False`). If set to `True`, adds a `_metadata` column containing file metadata to the resulting table.
- Methods `get_nearest_items` and `get_nearest_items_asof_now` of `KNNIndex` allow to specify `k` (number of returned elements) separately in each query.

## [0.7.2] - 2023-11-24

### Added
- Added ability of creating custom reducers using `pw.reducers.udf_reducer` decorator. Use `pw.BaseCustomAccumulator` as a base class
  for creating accumulators. Decorating accumulator returns reducer following custom logic.

- SQLite input connector (`pw.io.sqlite`).

### Changed
- `pw.debug.parse_to_table` is now deprecated, `pw.debug.table_from_markdown` should be used instead.
- `pw.schema_from_csv` now has `quote` and `double_quote_escapes` arguments.

### Added

- Experimental Google Drive input connector.
- Stateful deduplication function (`pw.stateful.deduplicate`) allowing alerting on significant changes.
- The ability to split data into batches in `pw.debug.table_from_markdown` and `pw.debug.table_from_pandas`.

## [0.7.0] - 2023-11-16

### Added
- class `Behavior`, a superclass of all behavior classes.
- class `ExactlyOnceBehavior` indicating we want to create a `CommonBehavior` that results in each window producing exactly one output (shifted in time by an optional `shift` parameter).
- function `exactly_once_behavior` creating an instance of `ExactlyOnceBehavior`.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `WindowBehavior` is now called `CommonBehavior`, as it can be also used with interval joins.
- **BREAKING**: `window_behavior` is now called `common_behavior`, as it can be also used with interval joins.
- Deprecating parameter `keep_queries` in `pw.io.http.rest_connector`. Now `delete_completed_queries` with an opposite meaning should be used instead. The default is still `delete_completed_queries=True` (equivalent to `keep_queries=False`) but it will soon be required to be set explicitly.

## [0.6.0] - 2023-11-10

### Added
- A flag `with_metadata` for the filesystem-based connectors to attach the source file metadata to the table entries.
- Methods `pw.debug.table_from_list_of_batches` and `pw.debug.table_from_list_of_batches_by_workers` for creating tables with defined data being inserted over time.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `pw.debug.table_from_pandas` and `pw.debug.table_from_markdown` now will create tables in the streaming mode, instead of static, if given table definition contains `_time` column.
- **BREAKING**: Renamed the parameter `keep_queries` in `pw.io.http.rest_connector` to `delete_queries` with the opposite meaning. It changes the default behavior - it was `keep_queries=False`, now it is `delete_queries=False`.

### Added
- A method `get_nearest_items_asof_now` in `KNNIndex` that allows to get nearest neighbors without updating old queries in the future.
- A method `asof_now_join` in `Table` to join rows from left side of the join with right side of the join at their processing time. Past rows from left side are not used when new data appears on the right side.

## [0.5.2] - 2023-10-19

### Added
- `interval_join` now supports forgetting old entries. The configuration can be passed using `behavior` parameter of `interval_join` method.
- Decorator `@table_transformer` for marking that functions take Tables as arguments.
- Namespace for all columns `Table.C.*`.
- Output connectors now provide logs about the number of entries written and time taken.
- Filesystem connectors now support reading whole files as rows.
- Command line option for `pathway spawn` to record data and `pathway replay` command to replay data.

## [0.5.1] - 2023-10-04

### Fixed
- `select` operates only on consistent states.

## [0.5.0] - 2023-10-04

### Added
- `Schema` method `typehints` that returns dict of mypy-compatible typehints.
- Support for JSON parsing from CSV sources.
- `restrict` method in `Table` to restrict table universe to the universe of the other table.
- Better support for postgresql types in the output connector.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: renamed `Table` method `dtypes` to `typehints`. It now returns a `dict` of mypy-compatible typehints.
- **BREAKING**: `Schema.__getitem__` returns a data class `ColumnSchema` containing all related information on particular column.
- **BREAKING**: `tuple` reducer used after intervals_over window now sorts values by time.
- **BREAKING**: expressions used in `select`, `filter`, `flatten`, `with_columns`, `with_id`, `with_id_from` have to have the same universe as the table. Earlier it was possible to use an expression from a superset of a table universe. To use expressions from wider universes, one can use `restrict` on the expression source table.
- **BREAKING**: `pw.universes.promise_are_equal(t1, t2)` no longer allows to use references from `t1` and `t2` in a single expression. To change the universe of a table, use `with_universe_of`.
- **BREAKING**: `ix` and `ix_ref` are temporarily broken inside joins (both temporal and ordinary).
- `select`, `filter`, `concat` keep columns as a single stream. The work for other operators is ongoing.

### Fixed
- Optional types other than string correctly output to PostgreSQL.

## [0.4.1] - 2023-09-25

### Added
- Support for messages compressed with zstd in the Kafka connector.

## [0.4.0] - 2023-09-21

### Added
- Support for JSON data format, including `pw.Json` type.
- Methods `as_int()`, `as_float()`, `as_str()`, `as_bool()` to convert values from `Json`.
- New argument `skip_nones` for `tuple` and `sorted_tuple` reducers.
- New argument `is_outer` for `intervals_over` window.
- `pw.schema_from_dict` and `pw.schema_from_csv` for generating schema based, respectively, on provided definition as a dictionary and CSV file with sample data.
- `generate_class` method in `Schema` class for generating schema class code.

### Changed
- Method `get()` and `[]` to support accessing elements in Jsons.
- Function `pw.assert_table_has_schema` for writing asserts checking, whether given table has the same schema as the one that is given as an argument.
- **BREAKING**: `ix` and `ix_ref` operations are now standalone transformations of `pw.Table` into `pw.Table`. Most of the usages remain the same, but sometimes user needs to provide a context (when e.g. using them inside `join` or `groupby` operations). `ix` and `ix_ref` are temporarily broken inside temporal joins.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where new-style optional types (e.g. `int | None`) were translated to `Any` dtype.

## [0.3.4] - 2023-09-18

### Fixed
- Incompatible `beartype` version is now excluded from dependencies.

## [0.3.3] - 2023-09-14

### Added
- Module `pathway.dt` to construct and manipulate DTypes.
- New argument `keep_queries` in `pw.io.http.rest_connector`.

### Changed
- Internal representation of DTypes. Inputting types is compatible backwards.
- Temporal functions now accept arguments of mixed types (ints and floats). For example, `pw.temporal.interval` can use ints while columns it interacts with are floats.
- Single-element arrays are now treated as arrays, not as scalars.

### Fixed
- `to_string()` method on datetimes always prints 9 fractional digits.
- `%f` format code in `strptime()` parses fractional part of a second correctly regardless of the number of digits.

## [0.3.2] - 2023-09-07

### Added

- `Table.cast_to_types()` function that can perform `pathway.cast` on multiple columns.
- `intervals_over` window, which allows to get temporally close data to given times.
- `demo.replay_csv_with_time` function that can replay a CSV file following the timestamps of a given column.

### Fixed

- Static data is now copied to ensure immutability.
- Improved error tracing mechanism to work with any type of error.

## [0.3.1] - 2023-08-29

### Added

- `tuple` reducer, that returns a tuple with values.
- `ndarray` reducer, that returns an array with values.

### Changed
- `numpy` arrays of `int32`, `uint32` and `float32` are now converted to their 64-bit variants instead of tuples.
- KNNIndex interface to take columns as inputs.
- Reducers now check types of their arguments.

### Fixed

- Fixed delayed reporting of output connector errors.
- Python objects are now freed more often, reducing peak memory usage.

## [0.3.0] - 2023-08-07

### Added

- `@` (matrix multiplication) operator.

### Changed

- Python version 3.10 or later is now required.
- Type checking is now more strict.

## [0.2.1] - 2023-07-31

### Changed

- Immediately forget queries in REST connector.
- Make type annotations mandatory in `Schema`.

### Fixed

- Fixed IDs coming from CSV source.
- Fixed indices of dataframes from pandas transformer.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-07-20

### Added
