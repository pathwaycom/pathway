#### Key Features:
- **Easy-to-use Python API**: Pathway is fully compatible with Python. Use your favorite Python tools and ML libraries.
- **Scalable Rust engine**: your Python code is run by a powerful Rust engine with multithreading and multiprocessing. No JVM and no GIL!
- **Stateful operations**: use stateful and temporal operations such as groupby and windows.
- **Incremental computations**: using Differential Dataflow, Pathway takes care of out-of-order data points for you, in real time.
- **Batch and streaming alike**: use the same pipeline on static data and live data streams.
- **In-memory data processing**: real-time updates, reduced latency, and higher throughput.
- **Easy to deploy** with Docker or Kubernetes. Pathway comes with an orchestrator and is fully compatible with OpenTelemetry.
- **Exactly once consistency**: obtain the same results in both batch and streaming.
- **Persistence and backfilling**: save the state of the computation to quickly resume after a failure or a pipeline update.
- **LLM tooling**: online ML, RAG pipelines, vector indexes... With Pathway, your ML pipeline works on fresh data.
- **Connect to any data source**: Pathway comes with 350+ connectors, including SharePoint. Or implement your own.
